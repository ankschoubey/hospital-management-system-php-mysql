# Hospital Management System Mini-Project

This **was Ankush Choubey's first short PHP project** for Web Technology subject created in October 2016.
I forked this project in January 2018 to make improvements such as adding more features and security. The goal
is to make a robust and secure system which can be used by any clinic/Hospital. 

## Installation:
Clone or download the repo.
Copy the directory to the www/root directory of your webserver.
Open up phpmyadmin and create a database called hospital.
Import the database.sql file into your database.
Then create an admin user then open the site in your browser.

## Features:
  1. Front Page Slideshow
  2. Login / Logout for customer.
  3. Seperate login for admin (location/hms-admin) - username: admin, password: admin
  4. Navigation Bar
  5. Ability to Add patient detail and book appointment.
  6. CSS using Twitter Bootstrap
  7. Stringent Access Controls
